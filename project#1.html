        <h2><u><strong>The Novel Coronavirus(COVID-19):</strong></u></h2>
        <p><font size="4">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">These viruses were originally transmitted from animals to people. SARS, for instance, was transmitted from civet cats to humans while MERS moved to humans from a type of camel.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The name coronavirus comes from the Latin word corona, meaning crown or halo. Under an electron microscope, the virus looks like it is surrounded by a solar corona.The novel coronavirus, identified by Chinese authorities on January 7 and since named SARS-CoV-2, is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans.</font></p>

      <h3><u>The Symptoms of Corona Virus or COVID-19 could be:</u></h3>
      <p>These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure (based on the incubation period of MERS-CoV viruses).</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Fever.</li>
      	<li>Cough.</li>
      	<li>Shortness of breath.</li>
      	<li>Trouble in breathing.</li>
      	<li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest.</li>
      	<li>New confusion or inability to arouse.</li>
      	<li>Bluish lips or face.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><font color="red" size="3">**This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#006400" size="5">*No vaccination has been found yet for this deadly virus.</font></p>
      <h3><u>Till there are some preventive measures to be followed:</u></h3>
      <ul>
      	<li>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.</li>
      	<li>There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li>
      	<li>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</li>
      	<li>Clean surfaces using soap and water. Practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces.</li>
      	<ul><li>High touch surfaces include:
			Tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc.</li></ul>
		<li>Social Distancing.</li>
			<ul><li>Stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people.</li>
				<li>Do not gather in groups.</li>
				<li>Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.</li>
				
			</ul>

      	<img src="new\Who logo.jpg" height="190" width="180" align="left">According to World Health Organization(WHO), this virus has been declared as <font color="red" size="5"><u>pandemic.</u><br>
      	</font>
      	It has been said-A new strain of coronavirus (officially named COVID-19), which has caused respiratory diseases in China, and spread to 24 other countries, has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO)<font color="green">(source: 3 Feb 2020).</font><br><br>
      	The first cases of COVID-19 occurred in a group of people with pneumonia, linked to a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, where many fish, reptiles, bats and other live and dead animals were traded. The disease then spread from those who were sick, to family members and healthcare workers.

		Coronaviruses circulate in a range of animals and can sometimes make the jump from animals to humans, via process known as a “spillover”, which can occur due to a mutation in the virus, or increased contact between animals and humans.

		It is not yet known how novel coronavirus was first transmitted to humans: in the case of MERS, it is known that people caught the virus via direct or indirect contact with infected camels, and SARS originated in civet cats.
